# DESCRIPTION              
Home automation has become an essential part of modern smart living, allowing users to control appliances and devices remotely using IoT (Internet of Things) technology. This project presents a Home Automation System that enables users to control electrical appliances wirelessly using a microcontroller (Arduino/ESP8266) and a relay module. The system provides seamless connectivity through Wi-Fi and can be accessed via a mobile application or a web interface.

This repository contains the circuit diagram and source code required to set up and deploy the Home Automation System. The project is designed to enhance convenience, energy efficiency, and safety by allowing users to control and monitor their home appliances remotely.

**Features**       
1. Remote Control of Appliances       
The system enables users to switch appliances (lights, fans, or any electrical devices) ON and OFF from anywhere using a mobile app or web dashboard. This eliminates the need for physical switches and offers flexibility in managing home electronics.

2. Wi-Fi Connectivity        
The system integrates an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, allowing seamless internet-based communication. This makes it possible for users to operate their home appliances through a smartphone, laptop, or any internet-enabled device.

3. Relay-Based Switching Mechanism                  
A relay module is used to control the appliances. When a signal is sent from the microcontroller, the relay switches the connected appliance ON or OFF, ensuring efficient electrical control.

4. Energy Efficiency                      
By automating control over appliances, users can optimize energy consumption. The system allows setting schedules or remotely turning off unnecessary appliances, helping reduce electricity wastage.

5. Real-Time Monitoring                       
The system provides real-time feedback on appliance status, allowing users to monitor which devices are ON or OFF at any given moment. This enhances security and ensures proper management of home electronics.

6. Expandable and Customizable                      
The system can be extended to support multiple appliances, integrate voice commands using Alexa or Google Assistant, or add sensors (motion, temperature, light) for automation based on environmental conditions.

**Components Used**

**Circuit Diagram**                   
The circuit diagram included in this repository provides a clear representation of how the components are wired together. The ESP8266 is connected to the relay module and Wi-Fi network, allowing communication between the microcontroller and the mobile/web interface.

**Code and Implementation**                          
The source code provided in this repository is responsible for:                      
Connecting the microcontroller to Wi-Fi                            
Receiving commands from a web dashboard or mobile app                               
Switching relays ON/OFF based on user input
